# Testing

## Junit

This project uses Junit for automatic unit testing. You can run the tests yourself by running the command 
```./gradlew run```
inside the *tiralabra-pathfinding/tiralabra-pathfinding* folder. All implemented algorithms and data structures are tested.

## Performance testing

Performance testing can be done on the graphical user interface. You can compare Dijkstra's A* search's and IDA*'s performance.

## Jacoco test report
Jacoco test report can be generated by running ```./gradlew jacocoTestReport``` inside the *tiralabra-pathfinding/tiralabra-pathfinding* folder. The report will be generated to *tiralabra-pathfinding/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html*. Jacoco ignores the UI as that is difficult if not impossible to unit test. Here are the current results:
