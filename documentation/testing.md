# Testing

## Junit

This project uses Junit for automatic unit testing. You can run the tests yourself by running the command 
```
./gradlew run
```
inside the *tiralabra-pathfinding/tiralabra-pathfinding* folder. All algorithms and data structures will be tested. 

Currently, IDA* is not being unit tested because it doesn't work properly yet.

## Performance testing

Performance testing can be done on the graphical user interface. You can compare Dijkstra's A* search's and IDA*'s performance.
