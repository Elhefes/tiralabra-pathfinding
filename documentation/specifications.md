## Specification
Bachelor's in Computer Science - Data Structures Lab

The project's goal is to implement a program which you can use to visualize and compare different path finding algorithms. The algorithms will find the shortest path from point A to point B. You will be able to compare how efficient the different algorithms are. I also intend to create a visual user interface where you can see how the path finding algorithm traverses it's path.

The data will be fetched from a image of a map and it will be processed to a two dimensional array. After that you will be able to choose the starting point and the end point of the path. Then that is used to run the path finding algorithms. You can choose to view the results after the algorithms have concluded or in real time as it traverses through the map. In the end you can see how well different algorithms performed.

## Algorithms and data structures
I will implement at least A* and Dijkstra, possibly IDA* or Fringe Search if there is time.

## Performance
Dijkstra's algorithm's time complexity is O(*n* + *m* log *m*). A* algorithm's time complexity depends on the heuristic used.
