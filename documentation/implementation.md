# Implementation

## User interface
The project uses JavaFX for rendering a graphical user interface for the program. Inside the UI you can visualize the path finding algorithms. 
You can also compare the different algorithms and how they perform against each other.

## Algorithms

The project has currently three algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* Search algorithm and Iterative Deepening A* algorithm. The IDA* doesn't work yet,
so currently you can't user that from the UI.
