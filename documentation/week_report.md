## Week 1
After familiarizing myself with the course material, I initialized the project with Gradle and setup Git. I also read some online materials on different path finding algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and IDA*. After that I started to write some basic documentation.

I am not yet sure that in which kind of format should I get my data to run the algorithms on. One possibility could be that I could get photos of maps for example from [here](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/street/index.html) and perform the path finding based on the colours of the photo. The black pixels in the photos could be walls and everything else space where the algorithms could traverse.

A fun feature to implement would be that the user could draw a map himself, and run the path finding algorithms on the drawing. That shouldn't be very hard to implement if I can display the algorithm results on the maps visually. I wonder if there would be any drawbacks for example in performance in showing the algorithm working in real time with a graphical interface such as JavaFX?

Next week I plan on beginning to implement some core features such as at least one of the pathfinding algorithms, and some kind of a UI to display the results.

Time used: 6 hours.
