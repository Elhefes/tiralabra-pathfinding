## Pathfinding algorithms comparison

This repository contains a project made for a course in University of Helsinki, [Data structures and algorithms project course](https://tiralabra.github.io/2021_p4/en/). The goal is to implement a program that you can use to compare various different path finding algorithms. It is written completely in Java as that is the preferred language in this course.

## Gradle
The project comes with gradle. You should run gradle commands from the tiralabra-pathfinding/tiralabra-pathfinding folder.

### Run the program
```
gradle run
```

### Generate checkstyle report
```
gradle check
```
or 
```
gradle checkstyleMain
```
The checkstyle report will be generated to *tiralabra-pathfinding/tiralabra-pathfinding/build/reports/checkstyle/main.html*
